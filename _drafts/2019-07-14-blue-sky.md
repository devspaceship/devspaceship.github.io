## Simple Answer

The molecules in the air scatter the light coming from the sun.
However, they do not scatter the light with different frequencies equally
and blue light (high frequency) gets far more scattered in the sky, giving it its color.


## Coulomb's Law

![Coulomb's Law](../img/blue-sky/coulombs_law.svg)

To understand how this works, we are first going to need to do some refresh.
This image represents the Coulomb's Law defined by:

$$ \vec{F} = k \frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2} \vec{e_r} $$

Here, $$ \vec{F} $$ represents the force applied by $$ q_1 $$ on $$ q_2 $$, $$ k $$
is the Coulomb's constant equal to $$ \frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0} $$
and $$ \vec{e_r} $$ is the unit vector going from $$ q_1 $$ to $$ q_2 $$.

Note that if both charges are of the same sign, the force is going to be repulsive,
whereas if the charges have different sign, their product will be negative and the force will be atractive,
which is aligned with what we would expect.

From this force, we can derive the electric field created by $$ q_1 $$:

$$ \begin{align}
  \vec{F} & = q_2 \vec{E}\\
  \implies \vec{E} & = k \frac{q_1}{r^2} \vec{e_r}
\end{align} $$
